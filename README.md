# Personal Portfolio

This is a simple React application that serves as a fictional personal portfolio. It showcases the developer's profile, interests, and contact information

## Features

1. **Profile Information**: The application displays a profile picture, name, job title, personal website link, and an email button.

2. **About**: The application includes an 'About' section that provides a brief description of the developer.

3. **Interests**: The application includes an 'Interests' section that outlines the developer's interests.

4. **Footer**: The application features a footer with links to the developer's social media profiles.

## Components

The application is composed of four main components:

1. **App**: This is the main component of the application. It imports and renders the Info, About, Interests, and Footer components.

2. **Info**: This component displays the developer's profile information.

3. **About**: This component displays a brief description of the developer.

4. **Interests**: This component outlines the developer's interests.

5. **Footer**: This component displays links to the developer's social media profiles.

## Styles

Each component has its own CSS file for styling. The styles are imported directly into the corresponding component file.

## Main Entry Point

The application is rendered into the root element of the page by the `main.jsx` file. This file imports the App component and the global styles, and uses ReactDOM to render the App component into the root element.
